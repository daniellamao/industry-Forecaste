Ongoing research and development have led to advancements in formulations and delivery methods for opioid antagonists. For example, the development of nasal spray and autoinjectors for naloxone has made it easier to administer, especially to non-medical personnel. The market has expanded in part because opioid antagonists are being investigated for uses other than overdose reversal. For instance, naltrexone's market potential has increased due to its use in preventing relapse in people with alcohol or opioid dependence.
