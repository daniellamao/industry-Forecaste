***Increasing Demand from Electric Vehicles to Drive Growth of the Global Injection Molded Plastics* *Market***

Global demand for injection-molded plastics has grown as a result of advancements in technology, creative materials, cost-effectiveness, flexibility in design, and sustainability consciousness. Injection molded plastics are becoming more and more necessary due to the increasing demand from a range of end-use industries, such as consumer products, automotive, packaging, electronics, and medical devices. For example, one of the top 12 light car manufacturers in the world is based in Canada. At their Canadian facilities, five significant OEMs—Stellantis, Ford, GM, Honda, and Toyota—assemble over 1.4 million automobiles a year. These operations get parts from about 700 vendors, including domestic Tier 1 firms like Magna, Linamar, and Martinrea. Moreover, Canada is home to one of the five machine-tool-die-and-mould (MTDM) manufacturing clusters.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global injection molded plastics** Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surging Need for Injection-Molded Plastics Is Driven by The Food and Beverage Industries
- Growing Construction and Expansion Activities* 

***Challenges:***

The significant environmental implications of plastic manufacture and disposal may affect the injection molded plastic market. These effects are becoming increasingly significant as more individuals learn about the environmental issues associated with plastic waste. One of the main implications of plastic manufacturing on the environment is the usage of non-renewable resources, or the significant amounts of fossil fuels required to produce plastic. Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are also caused by fossil fuels. Moreover, it might take hundreds of years for plastic waste to decompose, which results in an accumulation of plastic waste in landfills and oceans. The Plastic Production and Disposal Have a Range of Environmental Effects which is expected to hamper the market growth.

The global injection molded plastics** market is segmented into raw material and application, where raw material is sub-segmented into polypropylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, high density polyethylene and polystyrene. By the end of 2035, the polypropylene segment is anticipated to garner the largest revenue of USD 166.56 billion with a CAGR of 4.31% over the forecast period. Polypropylene is a prominent player in the global injection molded plastic sector due to its diverse uses, which promotes segment expansion. Polypropylene, which is often supplied in pellet form, works well for injection molding. Polypropylene is semi-crystalline, yet its low melt viscosity makes it flow amazingly nicely and molds easily. They are useful for things like car batteries, kiddie pools, toys, silverware, Tupperware, and the caps on bottles of ketchup and shampoo that aren't meant to support weight. Polypropylene liquefies rather than burns to make injection molding and subsequent recycling easier, which helps to drive the market's growth. Global production of polypropylene was estimated to be 79.01 million metric tons in 2022. 

Over the forecast period of 2022-2035, the European injection molded plastics** market is predicted to develop at a CAGR of 3.19%. The European market was worth USD 57.59 billion in 2022, and it is expected to be worth USD 86.53 billion by the end of 2035. Plastic composite materials are gaining popularity as a lightweight solution for automobiles in the region. For instance, the European Commission estimates that 13.8 million Europeans are employed directly or indirectly in the automotive sector, accounting for 6.1% of all jobs in the EU.
