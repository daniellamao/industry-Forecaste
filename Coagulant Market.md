**Market Definition of Coagulant** 

Coagulating agents are used to thicken any liquid, mostly water, and blood, by manipulating the electrostatic charges of the particles present in the water. Coagulant compounds are made up of positively charged molecules, which help to provide effective neutralization of water. It is widely used in water treatment plants, to easily remove solid waste from water. In recent times, recycling wastewater has garnered significant prominence, which has resulted in the rise of wastewater treatment plants. The separation of these coagulated waste materials from water is called flocculation, which is a major application of inorganic coagulants.

**Global Coagulant Market: Growth Drivers** 

The growth of the global coagulant market can majorly be attributed to the escalating use of coagulants in the healthcare sector, to boost the blood clotting process in patients of surgery along with the surge in the number of surgeries. *As of 2002 statistics, it is found that 15 million Americans have some kind of surgery every year.* On the other hand, the market is also anticipated to grow on the back of growing investments to treat water pollution caused by industries. *For instance, it was found that in 2020, nearly USD 700 million was utilized to treat wastewater pollution caused by industrial production in China.*

The global coagulant market is also estimated to grow majorly on account of the following: 

- Increasing number of accidents
- Rising prevalence of water-borne diseases
- Growing concern about contaminated water



**Global Coagulant Market: Restraining Factor** 

The rising adoption of alternatives such as RO and UV water treatment processes is hampering the market growth. The rising concern about the generation of a large volume of toxic metal hydroxide sludge having carcinogenic properties is also expected to be a hindrance to the growth of the global coagulant market during the forecast period. 



**Global Coagulant Market Segmentation**   

- **By Type (Organic, and Inorganic)** 

The inorganic segment, amongst all the other segments, is anticipated to garner the largest revenue by the end of 2035. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the growing use of inorganic coagulants in the water treatment industry with the rising global awareness regarding the proper treatment of wastewater, *as it is observed that, more than 80% of the world’s wastewater flows back into the environment without being treated.* 

- **By End-User Industry (Pharmaceutical, Chemical, Water Treatment, Research, and Others)**
- **By Region** 

The Asia Pacific coagulant market is anticipated to hold the largest market share by the end of 2035 among the market in all the other regions. The growing government initiatives in these countries to provide more and more people with safer drinking water to curb the unsafe supply of water along with an increasing number of water treatment plants in developing countries, such as China, Japan, Taiwan, India, and others, is estimated to boost the market growth in the region. *As per a report by the Global Water Forum, 42% of the deaths associated with an unsafe supply of water occurred in Asia in the past decade. Growing mass awareness regarding water pollution is also a major driver for regional market growth.*
